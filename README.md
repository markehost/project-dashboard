# Project Dashboard

This was created from `create-react-app` with `redux`, `glamorous` and several other utilities added.

## How to Run the Apps

Make sure you have the latest version of Node

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/markehost/project-dashboard.git

$ cd project-dashboard

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

The browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` in your default browser.
